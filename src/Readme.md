- You have to make sure ``RUST`` AND ``CARGO`` are install in your machine if not you can install it using the command  ``curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -ssf https://sh.rustup.rs |sh``
- In your projects directory create another directory rust using the command ``mkdir rust``
- inside the rust directory run the command ``cargo new simple-calculator``
- Then enter the directory using the command ``cd simple-calculator``
- When your in the directory then open it on VS code using the command ``code simple-calculator``
